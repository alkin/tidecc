extern void as_get_data() is called from 0 sites in this file.
    It appears to be inlineable (size = 22 units)
    It has 3 non-trivial scope blocks nested 3 deep.
    It calls these functions:
	as_read_register() (3 times)

extern void as_init() is called from 0 sites in this file.
    It appears to be inlineable (size = 28 units)
    It has 3 non-trivial scope blocks nested 3 deep.
    It calls these functions:
	<NONE>

extern unsigned char as_read_register() is called from 3 sites in this file.
    It appears to be inlineable (size = 79 units)
    It has 3 non-trivial scope blocks nested 3 deep.
    It calls these functions:
	<NONE>

extern void as_start() is called from 0 sites in this file.
    It appears to be inlineable (size = 83 units)
    It has 3 non-trivial scope blocks nested 3 deep.
    It calls these functions:

	Timer0_A4_Delay() (2 times)

extern void as_stop() is called from 0 sites in this file.
    It appears to be inlineable (size = 28 units)
    It has 3 non-trivial scope blocks nested 3 deep.
    It calls these functions:

extern unsigned char as_write_register() is called from 4 sites in this file.
    It appears to be inlineable (size = 83 units)
    It has 3 non-trivial scope blocks nested 3 deep.
    It calls these functions:
	<NONE>


These functions may be recursive:
	as_start()

These external functions are called but not defined here:
	Timer0_A4_Delay()
